// Highest income between 2018 and 2022 is $100,000
// Standard Fundable Amount should be $21,500 (21.5% of highest income since it is less than $10 billion)

// Because the company name does not start with a vowel,
// The Special Fundable Amount checks to see whether the 2022 income is less than the 2021 income
// Because it is, the Special Fundable Amount is $16,125 (25% less than Standard Fundable Amount)
